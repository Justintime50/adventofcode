> The real challenge is writing good code - quickly, without hating how it turns out.

**Note:** Everyone's data will be different, while the scripts should work for anyone, you'll need to adjust the `static_data` content of each day if you want to use it for yourself.

## Install

```bash
# Install locally
make install

# Get Makefile help
make help
```

## Usage

Each day you'll get a prompt containing two parts. Find the [promps here](prompts).

Run a script for a particular day, the output should be the answer you can plug into the Advent of Code daily challenge.

```bash
venv/bin/python adventofcode/twentytwenty/day1.py
```

## Development

```bash
# Lint the project
make lint

# Run tests
make test

# Run test coverage
make coverage
```
